# This file is used by /etc/init.d/lm_sensors and defines the modules to
# be loaded/unloaded. This file is sourced into /etc/init.d/lm_sensors.
#
# The format of this file is a shell script that simply defines the modules
# in order as normal variables with the special names:
#    MODULE_0, MODULE_1, MODULE_2, etc.
#
# Please note that the numbers in MODULE_X must start at 0 and increase in
# steps of 1. Any number that is missing will make the init script skip the
# rest of the modules. Use MODULE_X_ARGS for arguments.
#
# List the modules that are to be loaded for your system
